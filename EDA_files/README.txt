These are the updated test and train files based on Xing's train/ split, and
using almost all of Emmanuels EDA code with a few changes.

Note: These files are not normalized or standarized. I found it's the
robust scaler giving negative values.

However these files are corrected for skew and dummified. Additionally these files keep the last occurence of a patient and omits all other accounts of that patient
